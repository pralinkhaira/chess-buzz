              <p class="first-paragraph">
                <span class="drop-cap">C</span>hess Buzz started as a personal
                improvement project inspired by the work of Alex Petrusca. I
                came across his repository and really appreciated the idea and
                implementation. However, the project appeared mostly inactive,
                and I wanted to make some changes tailored to my own workflow
                and usability preferences.
              </p>

                  margin-top: 5px;
                ">
                <li>Improve the UI for better clarity and comfort</li>
                <li>Refine certain interactions for smoother gameplay</li>
                <li>Fix minor bugs and edge-case issues I encountered</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                As I worked on it, the project gradually evolved beyond just
                small tweaks. I redesigned parts of the interface to feel more
                modern and minimal, optimized performance in certain areas,
                improved responsiveness, and cleaned up parts of the codebase
                for maintainability.

                Chess Buzz is not just a copy or mirror. It is a customized and
                enhanced iteration built with my own design choices, structural
                adjustments, and improvements focused on usability and
                stability.

                implementation that inspired this work. Chess Buzz represents my
                own take on improving and extending that idea.
